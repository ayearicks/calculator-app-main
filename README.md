## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### Continued development

After the tri-state selector button gave me too much of a hassle, I decided to set this project down for now. In the very near future, and with fresh eyes, I plan to go back and implement the other two UI themes to this project.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Would not have been able to figure out the calculator functionality without help from the MSN Docs.
